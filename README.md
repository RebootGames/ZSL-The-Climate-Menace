## GameOverview

### Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “GreenHouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### Scope

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “GreenHouse Menace”. The App is for a target age of 12-15 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and inteactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

### The Planning

In order to get the correct product to the client, the team met up and made sure that we were all on the same page when it came to the same IDE's we would be using to the the right programming language and what timetable that we would have. We met on serveral occasions regarding points about the app and how it would work, the first meeting was for information on the project, this was followed by a pitch meeting, this was where we had a design for our app. Through our presentation we where able to accurately show how the app was going to work, this allowed for feedback in what was good and bad in our app and we where able to use that for improvement to the app.

Before meetings there where some issues with the powerpoint presentation as it had been created in google docs then transferred over to Microsoft PowerPoint, however those problems where managed to be fixed before the pitch had started. As well as this the group made handouts for the clients to make sure that any information that was missed or not communicated properly would still be showed to the client. With these handouts we where able to resolve an issue with the app before it was too late to have any big inpact on the design process.

After meeting we made sure to cover all of the risks and problems that we could encounter on the project. For example if someone was to have issues with a certain part of building the program, would there be help from the team and if so, was there flexability within the group to help. We took these risk into consideration and tried to make technical solutions to each of them. With us doing this it meant that most of the risks that could have been prevented were, this process saved much time and recources and allowed us to use our time much more effectively in the project.



### Feedback

On parts of the ZSL project, there were meetings on the project to show what the app was looking like and if it was going in the right direction of what they wanted. The feedback that our group got on the first pitch was very eye-opening as it showed us that we had been going in a wrong direction with our app. The feedback that we got that our app was not informative enough and interactive sides of it were lacking allowed us to look back at our app and make changes to the app to fit the clients needs. This included changing the interactive side of it completely as well as adding in more parts to make it more informational.

### Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

### Story 

The story relates to the green house gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing proccess of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacutring proccess or segments of the green house gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the proccess once. Moreover once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which green house gases are emmitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### Application Structure 

The Menu will consist of four images, each representating a different area or enviroment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

![Game Menu](https://github.com/LukeShead/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Mockup%20App%20Menu.png)


Furthermore the graphic styles within the enviroments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production proccess of a product relevant to that enviroment. Moreover after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous draggable images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the green house gas chain has been compeleted and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released,with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and  straightforward discussion  (as to what should be inputted).

### Genre 

	2D

	Educational

	Memory Game

### Intended Audience

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.

### Sound Consideration

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client(no sound or audio).

### Language 

The only language avaliable in the game will be english. 

## Game Mechanics | InGame Elements

### Camera 

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges  and chain.

### General Movement

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### Fonts

Ingame Font: 
Jupiter (Menu,Game Screen)
.... (Comic Font)

Project Definition

Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.

#### Monday 2nd- 8th
We first started with a 1 hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45 minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.
